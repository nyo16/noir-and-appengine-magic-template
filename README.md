# noir-and-appengine-magic-template

The initial starting point for my infinite social wall hosted application. It should serve as a good base for any noir/appengine application.
To use this as a template for a noir/appengine project, you'll just need to replace all instances of infinite-social-wall with your app title.

## Usage

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```

for appengine magic test:
```lein appengine-prepare
